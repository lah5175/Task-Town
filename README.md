# Task Town

Note: Task Town is not functional yet and is still boilerplate code. In the future, it will have all of the below features.

## Description

Task Town is a productivity app designed to gamify your daily tasks. It is designed more around a single-user experience. Whereas other apps of this
type aim for an RPG-like experience, Task Town is a resource management game where you gain gold and resources from completing tasks and use them
to construct buildings and other structures in your town which improve the rate at which you gain resources. The more buildings you construct, the
more features of the app will become available to you (such as quests, adventures, etc.).

## How does Task Town incentivize you to build your town and continue fulfilling your real-world tasks?

As you gain resources and build more structures, the experience becomes more and more like a game. As stated in the description, your structures will
begin to yield more as you upgrade them, and you will gain access to new and exciting options to gain even more special items and resources. Once you
purchase a guild, for example, you can send adventurers out on quests. Your actions and preparations will determine if they are successful or not, and
whether they bring home the unique rewards that you gain from these missions.

Task Town also takes advantage of positive reinforcement by encouraging you to set rewards for yourself as you complete more and more tasks. Your progress
towards these rewards will be tracked on the main page once you signed in so they are always visible as a goal to work towards.

## What is the calendar view?

For some individuals, it is helpful to consult a calendar when planning their schedules. For this reason, Task Town has a handy calendar view which shows you, at a glance, the tasks to be completed over the course of a week or a month. To access the calendar, click on the calendar icon to the left of the settings button.
